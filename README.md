## Manual Forward and Back Propagation

Forward and Back Propagation steps were manually conducted for a neural network with 1) input layer with 2 neurons, 2) single hidden layer with 2 neurons and 3) Output layer with 2 neurons. Schematic diagram with initial weights is as per the below figure:

Input Values are i1 = 0.05, i2 = 0.1 

Output values are t1 =  0.01, t2 = 0.99  

Loss function used in the network is calculated as below

Equations for forward and backward propagation are provided in the sheet "Parameter Calcs"

Key Steps for Back propagation as below: 
1. Start from the last neuron - E_Total
2.
